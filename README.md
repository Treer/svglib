# SvgLib

A personal-use fork of [SvgLib](https://github.com/huysentruitw/svglib), adding:
 * Inkscape Layers support
 * some compatibility with Godot's Vector2 types

The purpose of this fork is just to provide a fast easy way to save SVG files to visualize/debug geometry being generated in a Godot C# project.
